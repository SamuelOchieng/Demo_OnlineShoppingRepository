    <p>Released in September 2023, the Apple Watch Series 9 is brand new and won't be refreshed for another year.
        For that reason, now is the time to buy the Apple Watch Series 9.
        Apple's Series 9 is the middle-tier Apple Watch, and this year's model features a faster S9 chip, brighter display, and a new Double Tap feature, but no other new features.
        If you want something more affordable, it's best to check out the Apple Watch SE.
        If you can wear a larger watch, want the top-of-the-line features, or do a lot of outdoor activities, you will want to check out the Apple Watch Ultra.
        If you're having trouble deciding which Apple Watch is for you, we have a series of Buyer's Guides that walk you through all of the differences.
        You'll also want to check out our Apple Watch deals page to make sure you get the best price.

        The Huawei Watch Fit is the brand’s latest fitness tracker, and sits somewhere between budget activity bands and serious running watches.
        Earlier this year, we saw the Watch GT 2 and Watch GT 2e from Huawei, both of which came with solid fitness tracking, but were held back by software limitations.
        The Watch Fit doesn’t improve anything on the software front, but it’s a different kind of value proposition from Huawei that brings most of the fitness and health tracking suite found on the Watch GT 2e in a lightweight design that’s accessible, easy to use and, most importantly, affordable.
        Huawei is clearly going after the likes of the Fitbit Charge 4 and Garmin Vivosport with the Watch Fit, and has a big advantage by offering an AMOLED display in a slim design with a 10-day battery life, all at a lower price.

        It’s a good-looking watch to be honest. The rubber straps are soft and nice on the hand.
        They’re also removable – so I believe you’ll be able to switch to other straps if you want to in future.

        The square screen looks nice too. And though the watch may appear thick, it is not.
        It’s also very light on the hand. The only issue is the display feels quite washed out.

        On one side there are two buttons. They’re quite tactile.
        Between them there’s what appears to be a microphone.
        The top button which has a green accent finish is for returning to the main interface.
        The bottom button is a shortcut button for quickly accessing workout modes.

        At the back there’s quite a lot of text. At the center you get the sensors that help with heart rate monitoring and other trackers.
        On the side there are two cut outs that appear to be the speakers. And at the bottom you get the charging pins.
